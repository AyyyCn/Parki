## 📞 Usage
Parki simplifies the parking experience with an easy-to-use mobile app where users can:
- **Create an Account**: Sign up and log into the Parki app. Navigate through a simple setup process to enter personal information and vehicle details.
- **Add License Plates**: Users can add their vehicle's license plate to their profile, allowing the system's LPR technology to automatically recognize their vehicles upon entry and exit.
- **Make Reservations and Payments**: After adding their vehicle, users can use the app to check real-time parking availability, make reservations, and automate payments. When the camera scans a registered license plate at the parking entrance, it checks if the vehicle has a reservation or needs to make a payment.
- **Manage Parking History**: Users can view their parking history, manage vehicle details, and load prepaid parking credits through the app.
